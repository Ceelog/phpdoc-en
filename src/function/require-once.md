require\_once
-------------

The *require\_once* statement is identical to <span
class="function">require</span> except PHP will check if the file has
already been included, and if so, not include (require) it again.

See the <span class="function">include\_once</span> documentation for
information about the *\_once* behaviour, and how it differs from its
non *\_once* siblings.
