Many extension-writing guides focus on simple examples first and ignore
the requirements of more complex implementations until later. Often such
guides must repeat themselves over and over in order to describe these
new features. This section describes extension structure from the
perspective of a mature, practical implementation, in order to prepare
users for needs and issues they will almost always encounter in the
process of extension development.
