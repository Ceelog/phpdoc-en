Old introduction
----------------

If you are about to begin developing PHP or Zend extensions, you need to
prepare yourself for the programming environment provided by the various
APIs. This part of the documentation tries to introduce the APIs
provided by the different PHP and Zend Engine versions available. Since
most of the information available here is somewhat outdated, you'll want
to read various files found in the PHP source, files such as
`README.SELF-CONTAINED-EXTENSIONS` and `README.EXT_SKEL` in addition to
the manual.
