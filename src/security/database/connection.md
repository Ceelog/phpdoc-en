Connecting to Database
----------------------

You may want to establish the connections over SSL to encrypt
client/server communications for increased security, or you can use ssh
to encrypt the network connection between clients and the database
server. If either of these is used, then monitoring your traffic and
gaining information about your database will be difficult for a would-be
attacker.
