The GeoIP extension allows you to find the location of an IP address.
City, State, Country, Longitude, Latitude, and other information as all,
such as ISP and connection type can be obtained with the help of GeoIP.

**Warning**

This extension does not support MaxMind's current "GeoIP2" databases,
only the "GeoIP legacy" database files.
