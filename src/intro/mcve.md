These functions interface the MCVE (Monetra) API (libmonetra, formerly
known as libmcve), allowing you to work directly with MCVE/Monetra from
your PHP scripts. MCVE/Monetra is Main Street Softworks' solution to
direct credit/debit/gift card processing for Linux/Unix/MacOSX/Windows (
<a href="http://www.mainstreetsoftworks.com/" class="link external">» http://www.mainstreetsoftworks.com/</a>
). It lets you directly address the credit card clearing houses via your
\*nix box, modem and/or internet connection (bypassing the need for an
additional service such as Authorize.Net or Pay Flow Pro). Using the
MCVE/Monetra module for PHP, you can process credit cards directly
through MCVE/Monetra via your PHP scripts. The following references will
outline the process.
