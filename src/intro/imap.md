These functions enable you to operate with the IMAP protocol, as well as
the NNTP, POP3 and local mailbox access methods.

Be warned, however, that some IMAP functions will not work correctly
with the POP protocol.

**Warning**

The IMAP extension is not thread-safe; it should not be used with ZTS
builds.
