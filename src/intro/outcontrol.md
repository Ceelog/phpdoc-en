The Output Control functions allow you to control when output is sent
from the script. This can be useful in several different situations,
especially if you need to send headers to the browser after your script
has begun outputting data. The Output Control functions do not affect
headers sent using <span class="function">header</span> or <span
class="function">setcookie</span>, only functions such as <span
class="function">echo</span> and data between blocks of PHP code.
