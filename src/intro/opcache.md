OPcache improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script bytecode
in shared memory, thereby removing the need for PHP to load and parse
scripts on each request.

This extension is bundled with PHP 5.5.0 and later, and is
<a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/ZendOpcache" class="link external">» available in PECL</a>
for PHP versions 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4.
