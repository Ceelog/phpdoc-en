The swish extension provides the bindings for Swish-e API. Swish-e
stands for "Simple Web Indexing System for Humans - Enhanced" and is an
open source system for indexing and search. Swish-e itself is licensed
under GPL license, but uses a clause that allows applications to link
against the library if every copy of the combined work is accompanied by
the URL to Swish-e source code. Here it is:
<a href="http://swish-e.org/" class="link external">» http://swish-e.org</a>.

**Warning**

This extension is *EXPERIMENTAL*. The behaviour of this extension
including the names of its functions and any other documentation
