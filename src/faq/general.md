**What is PHP?**  
From the <a href="/preface.html" class="link">preface of the manual</a>:

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is
borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific
features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers
to write dynamically generated pages quickly.

**What does PHP stand for?**  
PHP stands for *PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor*. This confuses many people
because the first word of the acronym is the acronym. This type of
acronym is called a recursive acronym. For more information, the curious
can visit

or the

**What is the relation between the versions?**  
PHP/FI 2.0 is an early and no longer supported version of PHP. PHP 3 is
the successor to PHP/FI 2.0 and is a lot nicer. PHP 8 is the current
generation of PHP, which uses the Zend engine 3 which, among other
things, offers many additional

**Can I run several versions of PHP at the same time?**  
Yes. See the `INSTALL` file that is included in the PHP source
distribution.

**I think I found a bug! Who should I tell?**  
You should go to the PHP Bug Database and make sure the bug isn't a
known bug. If you don't see it in the database, use the reporting form
to report the bug. It is important to use the bug database instead of
just sending an email to one of the mailing lists because the bug will
have a tracking number assigned and it will then be possible for you to
go back later and check on the status of the bug. The bug database can
be found at
<a href="https://bugs.php.net/" class="link external">» https://bugs.php.net/</a>.
