**Are there any PHP mailing lists?**  
Of course! There are many mailing lists for several subjects. The most
common community mailing lists can be found on our
<a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php" class="link external">» mailing list</a>
page.

The most general mailing list is *php-general*. To subscribe, send a
blank email message to
<a href="mailto:php-general-subscribe@lists.php.net" class="link external">» php-general-subscribe@lists.php.net</a>.
To unsubscribe, send a blank email to
<a href="mailto:php-general-unsubscribe@lists.php.net" class="link external">» php-general-unsubscribe@lists.php.net</a>.

You can also subscribe and unsubscribe using the web interface on our
<a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php" class="link external">» mailing list</a>
page, and unsubscribe instructions are included in the footer of every
mailing list message.

**Are there any other communities?**  
There are countless PHP-centric communities around the world, and we
have links to some of these resources (and information on how to learn
more) on our
<a href="https://www.php.net/support.php" class="link external">» Support</a>
page.

<!-- -->

**Can I start my own PHP mailing list?**  
Absolutely! In fact, we not only freely allow it, we encourage it!
Helping others by sharing your knowledge and experience with PHP helps
to foster the growth and development of the global PHP community and the
language itself.

**Help! I can't seem to subscribe to/unsubscribe from one of the mailing lists!**  
If you have problems subscribing to or unsubscribing from a mailing
list, it may be because the mailing list software can't figure out the
correct mailing address to use. If your email address is
*joeblow@example.com*, and you are trying to subscribe to php-general,
you can send your subscription request to
*php-general-subscribe-joeblow=example.com@lists.php.net*, or your
unsubscription request to
*php-general-unsubscribe-joeblow=example.com@lists.php.net*. Use similar
addresses for the other mailing lists.

The most common reason folks have a hard time unsubscribing from our
mailing lists is due to the use of mail forwarders. For example, if your
email address is danbrown@example.com, but you subscribed to the mailing
list with the forwarder php-lists@example.com and forward that to
danbrown@example.com, attempting to unsubscribe danbrown@example.com
will not work, as that address is not even known to our systems.
Instead, you will need to unsubscribe the address to which the mail is
being sent - in this example, php-lists@example.com.

<!-- -->

**Is there an archive of the mailing lists anywhere?**  
Yes, you will find links to some of the archive sites on the
<a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php" class="link external">» mailing list</a>
page. You will also find dozens of sites that archive and/or syndicate
our mailing list content by using your favorite Internet search engine
and searching for "php mailing list archives".

All mailing list articles are also archived as news messages. You can
access the news server at
<a href="news://news.php.net/" class="link external">» news://news.php.net/</a>
with a news client. There is also an experimental web interface for the
news server at
<a href="http://news.php.net/" class="link external">» http://news.php.net/</a>

<!-- -->

**What can I ask the mailing list?**  
Since PHP is growing more and more popular by the day, the traffic on
the php-general mailing list can be very heavy, ranging from 75 to 200
or more posts per day. Because of this, it is in everyone's interest
that you use the list as a last resort, when you have exhausted all
other avenues.

Before you post to the list please have a look in this FAQ and the
manual to see if you can find the help there. If there is nothing to be
found there try out the mailing list archives (see above). If you're
having problem with installing or configuring PHP, please read through
all included documentation and README's. If you still can't find any
information that helps you out, you're more than welcome to use the
appropriate mailing list.

To ensure that you receive the best responses (and to reduce the
likelihood of frustrating your fellow developers), please be sure to
post your question to the appropriate list. For example, if you are
having difficulties installing PHP, you should send your question to the
*php-install* mailing list. A caveat: some lists have similar names and
completely different uses; a question regarding PHP scripts on Windows
should be directed to the Windows PHP users list, *not* to the Windows
Internals list.

Before asking questions, you may want to read the paper on
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" class="link external">» How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>
as this is a good idea for everyone.

<!-- -->

**What information should I include when posting to the mailing list?**  
Posts like "I can't get PHP up and running! Help me! What is wrong?" are
of absolutely no use to anyone. If you're having problems getting PHP up
and running you must include the operating system being used, the
version of PHP you're trying to use, how you got it (pre-compiled, Git,
RPM, and so on), what you have done so far, and the exact error message
or present result.

This goes for any other problem as well: you must include an explanation
of what you have done, what you're trying to do, and any error messages
encountered in the process. If you're having problems with your source
code, you should include the part of the code that isn't working,
indicating which line is the problem by an appropriately-placed code
comment. Do not include more code than necessary though! It makes the
post difficult to read, causing many to ignore your request. If you're
unsure about how much information should be included, post what you
believe is immediately relevant to your present issue, and be prepared
to provide more information upon request.

Another important thing to remember is to summarize your problem on the
subject line. A subject like "HELP MEEEE!!!" or "What is the problem
here?" will be ignored by the majority of the readers.

And lastly, you're encouraged to read the paper on
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" class="link external">» How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>
as this will be a great help for everyone, especially yourself.
