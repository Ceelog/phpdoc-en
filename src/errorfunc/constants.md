Predefined Constants
====================

The constants below are always available as part of the PHP core.

> **Note**: <span class="simpara"> You may use these constant names in
> `php.ini` but not outside of PHP, like in `httpd.conf`, where you'd
> use the bitmask values instead. </span>

| Value | Constant                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Note                                                                       |

The above values (either numerical or symbolic) are used to build up a
bitmask that specifies which errors to report. You can use the
<a href="/language/operators/bitwise.html" class="link">bitwise operators</a>
to combine these values or mask out certain types of errors. Note that
only '\|', '\~', '!', '^' and '&' will be understood within `php.ini`.
