Books about PHP
---------------

As PHP grew, it began to be recognized as a world-wide popular
development platform. One of the most interesting ways of seeing this
trend was by observing the books about PHP that came out throughout the
years.

To the best of our knowledge, the first book dedicated to PHP was 'PHP -
tvorba interaktivních internetových aplikací' (*PHP - Creating
Interactive Internet Applications*) - a Czech book published in April
1999, authored by Jirka Kosek. Next month followed a German book
authored by Egon Schmid, Christian Cartus and Richard Blume. The first
book in English about PHP was published shortly afterwards, and was
'Core PHP Programming' by Leon Atkinson. These books covered PHP 3.0.

While these books were the first of their kind - they were followed by a
large number of books from a host of authors and publishers. There are
over 400 books in English, over 100 books in German, and over 50 books
in French or Spanish! In addition, you can find books about PHP in many
other languages, including Korean, Japanese and Hebrew.

Clearly, this large number of books, written by different authors,
published by many publishers, and their availability in so many
languages - are a strong testimony for PHP's world-wide success.
