HP-UX specific installation notes
---------------------------------

This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP on
HP-UX systems.

There are two main options for installing PHP on HP-UX systems. Either
compile it, or install a pre-compiled binary.

Official pre-compiled packages are located here:

Until this manual section is rewritten, the documentation about
compiling PHP (and related extensions) on HP-UX systems has been
removed. For now, consider reading the following external resource:
