Using Packages
--------------

There are a few pre-packaged and pre-compiled versions of PHP for macOS.
This can help in setting up a standard configuration, but if you need to
have a different set of features (such as a secure server, or a
different database driver), you may need to build PHP and/or your web
server yourself. If you are unfamiliar with building and compiling your
own software, it's worth checking whether somebody has already built a
packaged version of PHP with the features you need.

The following resources offer easy to install packages and precompiled
binaries for PHP on Mac OS:
