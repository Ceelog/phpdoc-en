Bug reports
-----------

If you think you have found a bug in PHP, please report it. The PHP
developers probably don't know about it, and unless you report it,
chances are it won't be fixed. You can report bugs using the
bug-tracking system at
<a href="https://bugs.php.net/" class="link external">» https://bugs.php.net/</a>.
Please do not send bug reports in mailing list or personal letters. The
bug system is also suitable to submit feature requests.

Read the
<a href="https://bugs.php.net/how-to-report.php" class="link external">» How to report a bug</a>
document before submitting any bug reports!
