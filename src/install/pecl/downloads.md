Downloading PECL extensions
---------------------------

There are several options for downloading PECL extensions, such as:

-   <span class="simpara"> The *pecl install extname* command downloads
    the extensions code automatically, so in this case there is no need
    for a separate download. </span>
-   <span class="simpara">
    <a href="https://pecl.php.net/" class="link external">» https://pecl.php.net/</a>
    </span> <span class="simpara"> The PECL web site contains
    information about the different extensions that are offered by the
    PHP Development Team. The information available here includes:
    ChangeLog, release notes, requirements and other similar details.
    </span>
-   <span class="simpara"> *pecl download extname* </span> <span
    class="simpara"> PECL extensions that have releases listed on the
    PECL web site are available for download and installation using the
    <a href="https://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.users.commandline.cli.php" class="link external">» pecl command</a>.
    Specific revisions may also be specified. </span>
-   <span class="simpara"> SVN </span> <span class="simpara"> Most PECL
    extensions also reside in SVN. A web-based view may be seen at
    <a href="https://svn.php.net/viewvc/pecl/" class="link external">» https://svn.php.net/viewvc/pecl/</a>.
    To download straight from SVN, the following sequence of commands
    may be used: </span>
      
    $ svn checkout http://svn.php.net/repository/pecl/extname/trunk
    extname  
-   <span class="simpara"> Windows downloads </span> <span
    class="simpara"> The PHP project compiles and offers Windows DLLs
    for most PECL extensions on the respective package page. </span>
