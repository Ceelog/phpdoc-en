About user notes
----------------

The user-contributed notes play an important role in the development of
this manual. By allowing readers of the manual to contribute examples,
caveats, and further clarifications from their browser, we are able to
incorporate that feedback into the main text of the manual. And until
the notes have been incorporated, they may be viewed in their submitted
form online, and in some of the offline formats.

> **Note**:
>
> The user-contributed notes are not moderated before they appear
> online, so the quality of the writing or code examples, and even the
> veracity of the contribution, cannot be guaranteed. (Not that there is
> any guarantee of the quality or accuracy of the manual text itself.)

> **Note**:

> For the purposes of license coverage the user-contributed notes are
> considered part of the PHP manual, and are therefore covered by the
> same license that covers this documentation (Creative Commons
> Attribution at the moment). For more details see the
