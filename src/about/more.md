How to find more information about PHP
--------------------------------------

This manual does not attempt to provide instruction about general
programming practices. First-time - or even just beginning - programmers
may find it difficult to learn how to program in PHP using this manual
exclusively. Instead, seek out a text more oriented towards beginners.

There are a number of active mailing lists for discussion on all aspects
of programming with PHP. If stuck with a problem, consider using these
lists. For support options, including mailing lists, view
<a href="https://www.php.net/support.php" class="link external">» the PHP.net support page</a>.
