Translations
------------

The PHP manual is available not only in various formats, but also in
various languages. The text of the manual is first written in English,
then teams of people across the world take care of translating it to
their native languages. If a translation for a specified function or
chapter has not yet been made, the manual's build system falls back to
the English version of it.

People involved in the translations start from the XML source code
available from
<a href="https://svn.php.net/viewvc/" class="link external">» https://svn.php.net/viewvc/</a>
and from it they translate to their mother language. They do *not use*
the generated versions (like HTML or plain text) as it's the build
system that takes care of the conversions from XML to human readable
formats.

At the moment the manual is available, partly or not, in over 10
languages.
