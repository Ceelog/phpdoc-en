Requirements
------------

If you want to build ktaglib you need at least taglib 1.5 installed. To
obtain the taglib see the
<a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html" class="link external">» taglib project page</a>.
Windows DLL's are build static against taglib, therefore there is no
need to have taglib installed.
