Introduction

Sadly, no matter how careful we are when writing our code, errors are a
fact of life. PHP will report errors, warnings and notices for many
common coding and runtime problems, and knowing how to detect and handle
these errors will make debugging much easier.

This new major version brings with it a number of
<a href="/migration80/new-features.html" class="link">new features</a>
and
<a href="/migration80/incompatible.html" class="link">some incompatibilities</a>
that should be tested for before switching PHP versions in production
environments.

Despite the fact that PHP 7.0 is a new major version, efforts have been
made to make migration as painless as possible. This release focuses
mainly on removing functionality deprecated in previous versions and
improving language consistency.

There are a
<a href="/migration70/incompatible.html" class="link">few incompatibilities</a>
and
<a href="/migration70/new-features.html" class="link">new features</a>
that should be considered, and code should be tested before switching
PHP versions in production environments.

Most improvements in PHP 5.6.x have no impact on existing code. There
are a

that should be considered, and code should be tested before switching
