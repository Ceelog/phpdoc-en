PHP, which stands for "*PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor*" is a widely-used
Open Source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited
for web development and can be embedded into HTML. Its syntax draws upon
C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. The main goal of the language
is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated web pages
quickly, but you can do much more with PHP.
