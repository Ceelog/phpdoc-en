Instruction separation
----------------------

As in C or Perl, PHP requires instructions to be terminated with a
semicolon at the end of each statement. The closing tag of a block of
PHP code automatically implies a semicolon; you do not need to have a
semicolon terminating the last line of a PHP block. The closing tag for
the block will include the immediately trailing newline if one is
present.

**Example \#1 Example showing the closing tag encompasing the trailing
newline**

``` php
<?php echo "Some text"; ?>
No newline
<?= "But newline now" ?>
```

The above example will output:

    Some textNo newline
    But newline now

Examples of entering and exiting the PHP parser:

``` php
<?php
    echo 'This is a test';
?>

<?php echo 'This is a test' ?>

<?php echo 'We omitted the last closing tag';
```

> **Note**:
>
> The closing tag of a PHP block at the end of a file is optional, and
> in some cases omitting it is helpful when using <span
> class="function">include</span> or <span
> class="function">require</span>, so unwanted whitespace will not occur
> at the end of files, and you will still be able to add headers to the
> response later. It is also handy if you use output buffering, and
> would not like to see added unwanted whitespace at the end of the
> parts generated by the included files.
