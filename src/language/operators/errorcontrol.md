Error Control Operators
-----------------------

PHP supports one error control operator: the at sign (@). When prepended
to an expression in PHP, any error messages that might be generated by
that expression will be ignored.

If you have set a custom error handler function with <span
class="function">set\_error\_handler</span> then it will still get
called, but this custom error handler can (and should) call <span
class="function">error\_reporting</span> which will return 0 when the
call that triggered the error was preceded by an @.

Any error message generated by the expression is available in the
*"message"* element of the array returned by <span
class="function">error\_get\_last</span>. The result of that function
will change on each error, so it needs to be checked early.

``` php
<?php
/* Intentional file error */
$my_file = @file ('non_existent_file') or
    die ("Failed opening file: error was '" . error_get_last()['message'] . "'");

// this works for any expression, not just functions:
$value = @$cache[$key];
// will not issue a notice if the index $key doesn't exist.

?>
```

> **Note**: <span class="simpara"> The @-operator works only on
> <a href="/language/expressions.html" class="link">expressions</a>. A

> variables, function and <span class="function">include</span> calls,
> constants, and so forth. You cannot prepend it to function or class
> definitions, or conditional structures such as *if* and
> <a href="/control-structures/foreach.html" class="link">foreach</a>,
> and so forth. </span>

See also <span class="function">error\_reporting</span> and the manual
section for
<a href="/ref/errorfunc.html" class="link">Error Handling and Logging functions</a>.

**Warning**

Currently the "@" error-control operator prefix will even disable error
reporting for critical errors that will terminate script execution.
Among other things, this means that if you use "@" to suppress errors
from a certain function and either it isn't available or has been
mistyped, the script will die right there with no indication as to why.
