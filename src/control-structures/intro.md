Introduction
------------

Any PHP script is built out of a series of statements. A statement can
be an assignment, a function call, a loop, a conditional statement or
even a statement that does nothing (an empty statement). Statements
usually end with a semicolon. In addition, statements can be grouped
into a statement-group by encapsulating a group of statements with curly
braces. A statement-group is a statement by itself as well. The various
statement types are described in this chapter.
