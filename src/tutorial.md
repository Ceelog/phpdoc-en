Here we would like to show the very basics of PHP in a short, simple
tutorial. This text only deals with dynamic web page creation with PHP,
though PHP is not only capable of creating web pages. See the section
titled <a href="/intro-whatcando.html" class="link">What can PHP do</a>
for more information.

PHP-enabled web pages are treated just like regular HTML pages and you
can create and edit them the same way you normally create regular HTML
pages.
