Predefined Constants
====================

The constants below are defined by this extension, and will only be
available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or
dynamically loaded at runtime.

**Warning**

SPL uses class constants since PHP 5.1. Prior releases use global
constants in the form **`RIT_LEAVES_ONLY`**.
