Socket Errors
=============

The socket extension was written to provide a usable interface to the
powerful BSD sockets. Care has been taken that the functions work
equally well on Win32 and Unix implementations. Almost all of the
sockets functions may fail under certain conditions and therefore emit
an **`E_WARNING`** message describing the error. Sometimes this doesn't
happen to the desire of the developer. For example the function <span
class="function">socket\_read</span> may suddenly emit an
**`E_WARNING`** message because the connection broke unexpectedly. It's
common to suppress the warning with the *@*-operator and catch the error
code within the application with the <span
class="function">socket\_last\_error</span> function. You may call the
<span class="function">socket\_strerror</span> function with this error
code to retrieve a string describing the error. See their description
for more information.

> **Note**:
>
> The **`E_WARNING`** messages generated by the socket extension are in
> English though the retrieved error message will appear depending on
> the current locale (**`LC_MESSAGES`**):

>     Warning - socket_bind() unable to bind address [98]: Die Adresse wird bereits verwendet
